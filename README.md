Project 3 File

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  In Project 3, the objective waas to create a code that to gather the user's input as either a word or item and return the numerical value and   item, then output a list with numerical value, finally output the list with the numerical value displayed as astrix.

What did you do particularly well?
  I feel as though I made the loops clean and uniform. My biggest thing that I struggle to add is detailed in-line comments which I am proud I added as many as i did and in detail.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I think I should continue to increase my in-line comments as it will help guide me through the proper coding. Cleaning up the while loops inside the main function(s) will help for future coding. Continuing practicing with Visual Studio on a Mac will help fine tune my skills, as I did not know how to add a header into the file, or ass files in the Explorer area. It just was not an option in the version I have downloaded on my Mac.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging part of the projectr was the "do/while" coding. I think mostly because I have not had enough practice with it, but also typing the proper functions and remembering to add "break" at the end of each case.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The skills that I believe will be transferable in my future career would be creating a main function, while loops, and inserting the information in a data file. Data files can be useful for statistical information and presentations.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I made this program maintainable and readable by creating clean codes and organized thoughts, along with in-line coding to explain the different functions throughout. It is adaptable by having different methods of accepted inputs.
